# Recursionless

This is accompanying material for my talk "Factor Recursion out of your codebase" to be given at ScalaX 2018.

This repo contains a very simple implementation for a minimal "recursion schemes" library, 
so that you can have a taste of what "recursion schemes" looks like. 

## About the name "Recursionless"

The name is inspired from the joke "There is still servers in Serverless!", but of course those servers are managed by someone else for you, so we pretend they are not there.
Recursion schemes is similar, there still recursion happening, but a library is doing it for you, so we don't have to deal with it's complexities.

## Running the examples

Make sure you have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) installed, then execute: 
```
sbt run
```
